50,2023,8,EB,"Everything is fine, except for the cold feel of the common areas. Maybe a little too futuristic, but there is no warmth. It's not spooky, but close to it. Rooms are comfortable, the bathrooms are great, the staff is accomodating."

30,2023,7,First class team,The team at the Armani were amongst the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. Friendly and helpful at every turn. Breakfast was truly amazing with unbelievably fresh fruit and vegetables. The room technology was cumbersome and overdone but the team was always there to help out. Overall we enjoyed our stay though I believe I would choose a bit more of a full service hotel in the future for the price point.

50,2023,7,Modernist Milano,"The Armani is a strikingly modern hotel in the heart of beautiful Milan. While extremely comfortable and well-appointed, it took a bit of work to get used to the iPad managed controls for everything from lights to televisions to doors. It is perfect for those who are very comfortable with technology. You enter on the ground floor and then take an elevator up to 7th floor reception. From there you take another elevator back down or up to your floor to find your room. It would have been helpful for someone to show us how the room worked, and even how to open the door, but that did not happen. We spent way too much time trying to figure out how the room worked. The mini-bar was complementary and we had a voucher for room service which we used. The three-story Armani store is just down the street from the hotel. The included breakfast was nice, but service was slow. The Concierge desk not very helpful either. Overall, an interesting but very non-traditional experience. When in Milan, I would prefer to see the sights not spend time on how to turn off the lights to go to sleep."

50,2023,6,Modern luxurious stay with very friendly staff,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights to explore Milan and do some shopping. The room we got was spacious with a large terrace. The staff was extremely friendly and helped us swiftly with all questions and requests we had. The location of the hotel is great, especially since it is right next to a metro stop"

50,2023,5,Better than heaven a true testament of Armani style and detail,No question this is the only place to stay in Milan . The staff is overly qualified. The building is extremely comfortable. The food is five star the location is central and convenient to all things Milan  There‚Äôs no question of selection this is the only one

50,2023,5,Outstanding time at Armani in Milan,Fantastic experience at the Armani Hotel in Milan. From the moment of arrival until I left the staff at the hotel went out of their way to make my trip completely enjoyable. Virtually all the staff recognized me by my name on each encounter. The Jr Suite was perfect in every respect including the desk area where I needed to work for a couple of hours each day. Restaurant at d bar were excellent as was the fitness level. And the location is spectacular. Will definitely go back ASAP.

40,2023,4,armani hotel milano,"location was great, staff not so great, asked for ashtray when arrived but didn't get it , asked for bathroom cleaning but nobody came to clean, children can't use swimming pool or jacuzzi what should be written on hotel site, we stayed one night less because rain was forecasted and we could not go to spa with our son, be careful when you receive check I got bigger bills twice,"

50,2023,3,"Exceptional service, design and amenities","Exceptional hotel -- the service and amenities leave nothing to be desired. Everywhere you look is beautifully designed. The rooms are modern, high-tech and very comfortable. The hotel is located within the best shopping district, steps to the Duomo and the Galleria. The staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"

50,2023,3,"Excellet location, service and design","The Armani hotel is beautiful, modern and elegant. The service and amenities are exceptional and it is located within the best shopping district, steps from the Duomo and several good restaurants are nearby. Rooms are beautifully designed and high-tech. Highly recommended."

50,2022,3,Greatest Experience in This Stylish and Well Designed Hotel,"I stayed in Armani Hotel Milano a couple of times. As you probably know, this is one of the best hotels in Milan. Nice style, top quality, great service. If you need to book or order anything concierge would do it for you right away. Make sure to check the Armani restaurant which is on the 7th floor, great steak, pasta, deserts, wines, etc.  Grazie Armani. I will be back."

50,2023,2,Beautiful experience.,"This was the most beautiful hotel I‚Äôve stayed in. Top service, amazing modern amenities I haven‚Äôt experienced in any other hotel. Perfect location. I‚Äôd 100 percent recommend this place! Everything was perfect. We controlled everything in the room with our iPad, the lights, music, shades. This is an epic hotel."

40,2023,2,"Beautiful hotel, needs maintenance and an upgrade","Beautiful property but needs some maintenance, is starting to look old, if you have been to the Dubai property, don‚Äôt expect the same level. Food‚Ä¶ not the best, sad to say that probably one of the worst pastas I had in Milan. But definitely a great hotel. Staff is awesome!"

50,2023,2,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff","The hotel is beautiful as one would expect, what made the difference were the receptionists etc. who were very helpful and kind. I was feeling unwell when I checked out and was so impressed that the person on reception arranged a bottle of water to be waiting for me when got to the ground floor"

50,2022,11,EXCELLENT STAFF,"Excellent location, remarkable service and food. Everyone was gentle and polite. We loved the privacy the hotels offers. Breakfast was great. The quality of the food amazed us!!! The desserts area was our favorite spot."

50,2022,12,Amazing Christmas with Armani!,"This was a superb stay, from beginning to end. The staff was kind, attentive, and paid attention to every detail. The drinks were 100%, and the food was excellent. Cannot say enough good things. We were there over Christmas, and the entire team went out of their way to make sure our stay was amazing. We hope to come back soon!"

50,2022,12,One of the best trip to Armani Milan,"Armani Milan made our trip to Milan is one of the best trip ever..location is fantastic ‚Äî everything is in a walking distance .. I took junior suite with balcony, and it was a very nice room with beautiful view.. will visit again for sure .."

50,2022,11,I love this hotel,"It is truly difficult to find a flaw in this hotel because it is simply perfect. To start with, the reservation staff was patient and courteous, they even called us before we arrived to make sure everything was alright. Then from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with kindness. Then they upgraded us to an executive suite without us even asking. It kept getting better from that moment on. The bathroom is so comfortable and spacious, the AC worked wonderfly, and the amenities covered everything from the toothbrush to everything else. The suit was smart and we were able to control everything with an eye pad. Relaxing music was always playing in the hallways. There was a business center. The breakfast was by far the best I ever had in a hotel. Housekeeping was always fast to‚Ä¶"

50,2022,11,One of the best hotel in Milano,"I do love the venue, as well as the team, was wonderful to deal with. They supported me with all kinds of services that you even can think about it. Once again highly recommended and thank the Armani team üôèüèª"

50,2022,11,Armani in the heart of Milan,The concierge services at this hotel is above and beyond. Excellent staff! Great location. Lighting is a bit dark and it is hard to see in the bathroom...otherwise great experience. Wonderful breakfast buffet.

50,2022,9,Armani/Millano,"Out of many optuions, I decided to stay in the Armani hotel. It met all of my expectations, cool design, prompt service, attentive staff. Nothing to complain about, quite to the contrary. Not my first stay and hopefuly not the last one."

50,2022,7,Summer in Milan at Armani,"Spacious room, friendly staff and housekeepers. I loved how high-tech all the amenities were and how comforting it is to get everything done through the iPad, including opening the door and ordering in-room dining. Contact was minimized to the comfort of the guests. Mini bar was constantly restocked and receptionists were very helpful with guiding us around the city for shopping and food cafes. Also, an extra +++ was the location. Everything was walking distance!"

30,2022,8,Outdated by now,"Even the hotel was once well designed, many interior parts are now worn out and don‚Äôt work well. Shame the main restaurant is closed for the whole of August so you must go outside for dinner. Hotel is on a main road so plenty of noise and does not look special compared to several similar nearby hotels. Hotel staff are amazing though"

50,2022,6,Great Location in the heart of Milano,Armani level of service is the best. The facility decor is breathtaking. The team is super professional and caring for your needs. Location is great and the restaurant is spectacular. Definitely recommended.

50,2022,5,Armani gets an ‚ÄúA+‚Äù,"When you enter the hotel, you are greeted cordially, your luggage is whisked away and you are transported to the reception area where you are welcomed again. Check-in is easy and then you are escorted to your totally fashionably (obviously) designed room with all the modern conveniences. An iPad has all the controls for the room, the curtains puddle beautifully, the bathroom is stunning in marble with a separate shower and tub, you can even close off the vestibule for a private food delivery. The staff is attentive and remembered us whenever we came by reception with a question. The food at the restaurant was delicious and beautifully presented. We are only sorry that we stayed only one night."

50,2022,5,Thank you Lifestyle team,"This hotel deserves a lot more than the flak reviews you read. First time staying here for our anniversary. The hotel room is nice and comfortable. Mini bar complimentary - which is a really really nice touch. Special thanks and mention to Paolo from front desk. He was so patient with the check, trying to find us a room on a higher floor and when he couldn't, he brought us to the room allocated and walked us through the room details like lights, ipad etc. We had a small issue but he resolved it promptly and efficiently and really showed what it means to stay at The Armani - fantastic customer service! Just top notch! Thank you to the service team and front desk. We really enjoyed our stay. The only thing that we would like to suggest is an improvement of the WiFi. We stayed‚Ä¶"

50,2022,5,Anniversary stay in Milan,"My 2nd stay at the Armani. The service is now top notch. Staff are friendly, service oriented and everything requested is attended to promptly. Our big big thanks to Paolo from frontdesk. From check in to attending to our queries and even a minor issue we had - everything was done with a smile and resolved quickly and promptly. Paolo deserves 10 stars! Thank you Armani and Paolo, for such service and a great experience! We will be back!"

50,2022,4,Enjoyable trip,"It is not the first time we visit Milan but it is the first time in Armani Hotel, it was great that we chose this hotel, its location, quality of rooms, services and staff, everything was great, I will never forget Mr. Faisal, Mr. Simone and Mrs. Lara, and I apologize for forgetting the other names. Thank you everyone for their kindness to my children. The room type was a family suite consisting of two interconnecting rooms."

An amazing team that generously responded to all our requests. Free minibar for the entire stay including refilling every day, Late check out free of charge. Receiving ‚Ç¨ 85 to use for extras at the hotel. 10% discount at Armani's flagship store."

50,2022,3,Milan Trip,"Great place brilliant location and staff are wonderful, i would recommend it to all my friends and stay again, i really enjoyed the bamboo bar and the room was great. having a parking service made life so easy."

50,2021,12,City Trip,"I had the most wonderful and comfortable stay. The rooms are of a good size with a big and luxurious bathroom. The Spa has a beautiful view of the city, from al areas. Jacuzzi is nice and big. Sauna‚Äôs are 1-2 persons, but multiple of them and also with a view of the city. Location is great ofcourse!"

50,2021,11,Magic weekend in Milan,Top notch service during Covid All perfect Very attentive service Nice in dining any time of the day Very nice spa with Jacuzzi and top view Very nice cocktails in the bar Perfect location next to Monte Napoleone area

50,2021,11,Definitely my favourite hotel in Milan,"Perfect hospitality. Sophisticated interior design and flawless service. This is my favorite hotel in Milan. I love the sleek yet modern vibe. The room, the room service, the breakfast, the turndown service, Bamboo Bar... extraordinary experience. I had a great time."

50,2021,11,Best Hotel in Italy,I stayed at the Armani w/ my family in the family room (bedroom w/ a connecting room). The size of both the bedrooms and bathrooms were great. The hotel is first class but the service they provide during your stay is incredible. You never wait for any request and the staff goes above and beyond to provide great service. I would suggest this hotel over any other in Milan.

20,2021,11,a shame at this price point,"I created a tripadvisor account just to report on the experience I had at the armani hotel in milan vs other hotels I stayed at recently: the occasion of stay was a couple night out at la scala for an opera, on the way back from Venice where we stayed at the Aman. For reference I have previously stayed at the Armani in Dubai and eaten in the Paris Armani restaurant and they were pleasurable experiences - room was a junior suite, budget 1'000‚Ç¨ plus - location is good - suite size is ok, bathroom of good size - design of interest but wear and tear are very present - technology is completely outdated and inoperative mostly: 1. the room was cold, putting the temperature up didn't fix it - a member of staff had to come and do something in the background 2. internet access‚Ä¶"

50,2021,11,Amazing hotel and service,"I have travelled the world, and I have stayed at some of the most exclusive hotels. Hands down this is one of the best hotels. The service and accommodations were flawless. We were upgraded to a junior suit. The room was huge and the amenities were fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel. You will not go wrong by staying there. The location is also great. We can‚Äôt wait to go back."

40,2021,10,"Good location, sleek hotel","Very sleek hotel and impressive to see. The location is excellent as it is just steps from high end shopping and walkable to the Duomo. The lounge and dining area are also very modern and cool. My criticism is the rooms themselves were not very functional, specifically the bathroom. There is almost no counter space for makeup. There are not many outlets. The outlet in the bathroom didn‚Äôt work, so I had to curl my hair sitting in the floor, using the refrigerator door as a mirror. The use of an iPad to control everything seems cool initially, but became annoying to turn on the lights and turn off the TV. Armani hotel is a nice hotel, but can use some modern updates to make it more functional."

50,2021,9,Armani - Home away from Home,"This is a Fantastic hotel and fantastic staff all around in the middle of Milan, central to everything via walking of by car or tram. Have always wanted to visit Milan and the Armani Hotel made it the best location for my first visit to the NYC of Italy."

50,2021,9,Mr. Mitja Mihic,"I love your property and book it whenever I come to town for my business trip, the service is wonderful and friendly, eager to help with a smile. I appreciate the attention to detail have a lovely day"
